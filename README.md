# Blockchain_Web3_DApps_Certificate_NFT

## The objective of the project (Business Need)
Web3 technology is a decentralized internet where users control their own data. 10Academy is our client that wants to solve the challenge of ensuring that certificates are available to all trainees in a secure way, and (if possible) that certificate holders can benefit from smart contract actions now and in the future. At present, certificates are distributed as simple PDF files, without the ability to verify their authenticity nor can 10Academy undertake smart actions with the trainees/their contracts. So, we will implement end-to-end Web3 DApp on he Algorand Blockchain that will help 10Academy generate and distribute Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) as certificates that will represent the successful completion of a weekly challenge to trainees, and allow trainees with NFTs to interact with a smart contract to perform pre-defined actions.actions.

## A bit about the Algorand blockchain (including basic stats like its market capitalisation, number of accounts etc.)
According to coinmarketcap, the Algorand max supply is equal to 10,000,000,000 ALGO and the total supply so far is equal to 8,043,053,473 ALGO. From Algorand explorer, there are 6 accounts as the below screenshot shows:
